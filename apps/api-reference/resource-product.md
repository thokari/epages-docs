A product is an individual item for sale that belongs to the inventory of a shop.
This item can be added to the shopping basket and then sold using the checkout.
Specific items can also be assigned to a category.
**Note**: In case of errors for certain products or unknown product IDs, the product collections will **not** return errors, but skip the products in question.
